# MinuteMediaPlayer Demo

A demo application showcasing the **MinuteMediaKit** SDK, including:

- A SwiftUI video player view (`MinuteMediaPlayerView`) that wraps `MinuteMediaPlayer`.
- Floating playback controls (play/pause, mute/unmute, rewind, skip, captions toggle).
- A live-editable UI configuration screen for colors, supported modes, and control visibility.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Two usage patterns**
  1. Embed `MinuteMediaPlayerView` directly.
  2. Instantiate and reuse a `MinuteMediaPlayer` instance, then pass it into `MinuteMediaPlayerView(player:configuration:)`.
- **Floating Controls**
  - Rewind 10s, Play/Pause, Mute/Unmute, Skip 10s, Toggle Closed Captions.
- **Edit UI Configuration**
  - `EditConfigurationView` lets you adjust:
    - Foreground & background colors
    - Which modes are supported (standard, full screen, minimized)
    - Which UI elements are shown (title, description, controls, progress bar)
    - Auto fullâ€‘screen behavior on landscape
- **Tab Navigation**
  - **Player**: View the video and controls.
  - **Edit Config**: Tweak the UI configuration in real time.
